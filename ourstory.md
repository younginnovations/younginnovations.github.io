    <p>We aren’t in the technology business to get rich (or die trying!), to build hip social media apps or to eventually make a killing on an IPO. YoungInnovations is a special kind of technology company. </p>
    <p>We specialise in global development; we build partnerships and technology that help development organisations to change the way the world works.</p>
    <p>Every line of code we write at YoungInnovations has an impact, which is appropriate, given that our key goal is to increase the impact of the work that global development organisations do. We build products, tools and websites that focus on solving problems by providing tailored and innovative solutions which work for your local context. By taking the time to understand the real needs of your end users, we never fail to build products which will be both used and useful. </p>
<h2 data-scroll-index="1">Our Approach</h2>
<p>We believe in the power of partnerships. We work with you to create tailored, innovative solutions in the areas of data, technology, product and community.</p>

     <p>We truly love data. Data can teach you so much when you know how to make sense of it, and our team are experts at making data sing!</p>
          
     <p>We can build automated data tools to collect, curate and analyze data for you, and we can help you to use that data to tell stories about your work, to identify issues with your programs, to spot gaps in execution and to see and capitalise on emerging trends, among many other things. We believe in the power of data-driven policy and decision-making, both at the large scale and on an everyday basis.</p>
     
     <p>We are experts in using data to help you drive impact. And as the creators of platforms such as <a href="http://aidstream.org/" target="_blank">Aidstream</a>, <a href="http://www.developmentcheck.org/" target="__blank">DevelopmentCheck</a> and <a href="http://opennepal.net/" target="__blank">OpenNepal</a>, we are well versed in building tools and technologies focused on using open data to facilitate transparency and accountability.

         <h3>Technology Innovations</h3>
         <p>If data is at our heart, then technology is our soul. We live, dream and breathe technology, and ‘innovation’ is an almost holy word in our office.</p>
         
         <p>With a tech team full of curious, resourceful developers, we build technology solutions that get right to the root of problems, rather than masking the symptoms. We believe that in the development sector, this is too seldom the case, despite being the key to increased impact and the delivery of real solutions.</p>
         <p>Whether it’s a new way to place mobile technology in the hands of rural women, to create feedback loops for local governments or to monitor post-disaster infrastructure, we help organizations to meet some of their most challenging goals. We do so with a focus on increasing accessibility and reach, while maintaining a belief in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/10/small-is-beautiful-economic-idea" target="_blank">E.F. Schumacher’s principle</a> of appropriate technology and recognising that technology can only be an effective part of the solution when it is relevant and appropriate for the people into whose hands you are placing it.</p>

        <h3>Product Innovations</h3>
        <p>Ensuring the long-term success of life-changing products requires more than just technical backstopping.</p>
        <p>By creating real partnerships with our clients, we grow to understand your business, your needs and the people you’re working to help. Your products become our babies, and we take excellent care of them from the moment they’re alive on the web and the whole way through their lifecycle. We build sustainability mechanisms into our products and will proactively create ways to ensure your product stays relevant and up to date. Our products live up to their promise so you can live up to yours.</p>
        <p>With a truckload of expertise in somewhat niche fields, we choose to reinvest much of our profit in building products that we believe will support many of our clients. For example, our own brainchild - <a href="http://aidstream.org/" target="_blank">Aidstream</a> - is the platform most widely used by development organizations to publish their data to the <a href="http://www.iatistandard.org/" target="_blank">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)</a>. Currently used by organizations in over 20 countries, AidStream is the dominant player in IATI ecosystem.</p>

          <h3>Community Innovations</h3>
          
          <p>We may be a technology company, but we’re also firm believers in human smarts so we don’t regard technology as some infallible standalone panacea.</p>
          <p>We know technology shouldn’t replace the necessarily human-led, hands-on nature of development work, but we do want to introduce new generations of technophiles to that work and help them to see it as a fascinating and worthwhile area in which to use their skills.</p>
          <p>As such, since 2010, when YoungInnovations established Mobile Nepal - a community of practice which aims to facilitate discussions on the issues, opportunities and challenges surrounding mobile technologies in Nepal - we have been heavily involved in fostering a strong tech and open data community in Nepal; as a key pillar of this community, we facilitate regular tech events such as Open Data Day, NASA's Space Apps Challenge and Ncell App Camp to name just a few. We believe that such events, when created in collaboration with national and international organizations, provide a common platform where individuals and groups can come together to generate real, innovative and creative solutions to the kinds of pressing problems faced by people every day in countries like Nepal.</p>
          <p>We believe in the human side of technology because we have seen innovation flourish through collaboration; because collaboration with others pushes us to think outside the box, drawing experience from multiple different people with different histories and cultures, we regard it is an essential ingredient in the future of effective and impactful technology.
