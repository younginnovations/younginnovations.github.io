         <p>Young Innovations builds custom products across several languages - PHP, Python, Node JS and Javascript - for a broad range of clients within the global development sector.

         <p>You will work closely with the Head of Product, the Chief Innovations Officer and the Director or Operations to create and implement processes which identify, analyze and document defects, functions, errors, and more in software. You will be an advocate for consistent and high quality standards across all of the company’s products, crafting best practices for coding and documenting code. We expect you to be heavily involved in the long term design and architectural decisions of both our QA process and product builds.</p>
