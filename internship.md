                <p class="motivators-story-card-wrap__list-story">Before joining, I was very much impressed by the uniqueness of YoungInnovations and also its mission for global development. I was very enthusiastic about being a part of an organization driven by youth spirit, where skills and growth are highly valued. Now, after being a part of YoungInnovations, I know that this has been one of the best experiences in my career. At YoungInnovations, I am amazed to see in action the synergy of cross-domain experts collaborating together for common goal.</p>

                <p class="motivators-story-card-wrap__list-story">YoungInnovations has changed me so much for the better when it comes to understanding key professional skills like communication and time management. These are things you rarely learn in college; but here I get to work in an environment where everyone celebrates learning! Being encouraged to ask questions of your (cooperative and very experienced!) seniors is very cool!</p>

                <p class="motivators-story-card-wrap__list-story">YI has taught me to continuously focus on my strengths and weakness. While I was careful during coding and took proper steps, I did begin to understand the multifaceted nature of programming language and how much skill is needed to be called up on any given day. Over the course of short time, I went from unknown outsider to a contributing member in the tight knit community. I also witnessed how important it is for naive programmer to have such a wonderful place to take first steps to begin a career and feel supported by helpful colleagues.</p>
